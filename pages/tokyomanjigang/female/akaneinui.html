                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    Prior Sala (サラ修道院長 Sara Shūdōin-chō?, lit. "Abbot Sara") is a character in the Castlevania animated
                    series. He is the mysterious leader of the monks in Lindenfeld and an antagonist who wishes to
                    resurrect Dracula.
                    <br><br>
                    Prior Sala and his monks come from the Lindenfeld priory to investigate when Trevor and Sypha arrive
                    to the town dragging a deceased night creature behind their caravan. He inquires if they killed it,
                    and when told they did, he approved as he stated his disgust with the night creatures that betrayed
                    Dracula at Braila. He professes sympathy with Dracula's revenge against Humanity for having killed
                    his wife. Sala also mysteriously comments that Lisa is "alive in Hell". The encounter results in the
                    Judge shooing the monks away for putting everyone on edge.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>
                    Prior Sala has a deeply intense and threatening demeanor. All who meet him instantly sense that he
                    is twisted and that they should tread lightly around him.
                    <br><br>
                    Once a normal priest, Sala felt two shocks that warped him. The knowledge that the Church was behind
                    the war on Wallachia challenged many a priest's faith. More significantly, an exceptionally powerful
                    night creature broke into his priory and turned the monks of the priory to its will.
                    <br><br>
                    Since then, Sala has been broken. Letting his priory fall into filth, and his congregation goes
                    insane. While he and his monks are clearly unwell, they are highly functional as defenders of the
                    priory.
                    <br><br>
                    Sala still believes in God, but believes that if God is perfect then sending Lucifer, the
                    light-bringer, to Hell was part of a greater plan. Hence Lucifer, the demons of Hell, the night
                    creatures, and Dracula are in fact bearers of the true wisdom. Sala is always seeking to learn more
                    about Hell, giving the educated Saint Germain an opening into the first level of the priory.
                    <br><br>
                    Sala worships Dracula, believing that his plan to kill all humans would bring humans to Hell, the
                    true land of God. He hates those who betrayed Dracula and seeks to revive him by opening a gate to
                    Hell.

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>
                    "Dracula sought to reunite us all in Hell with his beloved wife." ("Bless Your Dead Little
                    Hearts")<br><br>
                    "Dracula's wife is alive in Hell. Dracula went from Braila to join her there." ("The Reparation of
                    My Heart") <br><br>
                    "I wish you'd stop talking to me like I'm insane, Saint Germain. It's not like I am some demented
                    child that will wet itself if you stop patting me on the head." ("I Have a Scheme") <br><br>
                    "You have shown us the truth. We have listened. We have prepared. We have restrained you, as you
                    wished. We have given you time to meditate as you asked. God has abandoned the Earth. Dracula must
                    be brought back. It is what you want. It is what he who forged you would want. We do this in the
                    name of our Visitor, and his forgemaster, Isaac. When the sun goes down, we shall do what needs to
                    be done." ("What the Night Brings") <br>
                </p>

                <br>

                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>
                    Sala becomes increasingly impatient to learn of what Saint Germain discovers from the books he's
                    given access too, although he is placated when he learns the symbol on the armbands that he and his
                    monks were given by their "Visitor" is the alchemic symbol for Hell. However, Sala, as he rebuffed
                    Saint Germain about earlier, is not dumb and becomes suspicious of Germain's snooping about the
                    priory. He hastily begins the final preparations for The Harvest, revealing that the Visitor was
                    actually a large night creature that had previously attacked Lindenfeld and the priory, and pushed
                    the monks toward insanity in a bid to prepare for a ritual that would open the Infinite Corridor in
                    the priory's basement. The Visitor and the monks hope to open the Corridor and allow Dracula to
                    return to the world from Hell.
                    <br><br>
                    The Harvest commences, and the souls of the townsfolk of Lindenfeld are sacrificed along with the
                    Visitor's blood to open the portal to the Infinite Corridor. As demons begin to pour from the
                    portal, the Judge mounts an attack against the priory with Trevor and Sypha. The battle results in
                    Sala fleeing the building and attacking the Judge in a rage, stabbing the man with a knife and
                    mortally wounding him. As the Judge lies dying, he tells Sala of a secret exit from the town where
                    the prior can escape the chaos. Suspicious but panicking, Sala nonetheless follows the Judge's
                    directions and ends up falling into the pit of spikes trap the Judge had set up previously, killing
                    him.
