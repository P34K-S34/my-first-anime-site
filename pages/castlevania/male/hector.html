                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    Hector (ヘクター Hekutā?) is the protagonist of Castlevania: Curse of Darkness. He is a former general
                    of Dracula who had decided he had enough of killing and fled. A woman Hector had later found
                    contentment with was killed by his old comrade Isaac and he enters Dracula's domain in the game with
                    the intent of avenging his wife and himself upon Isaac.
                    <br><br>
                    A former Devil Forgemaster who betrayed Dracula three
                    years ago, allowing his fall by the hand of Trevor Belmont. After renouncing his powers, Hector had
                    been leading a normal life when his beloved was executed as a witch. He has vowed to exact vengeance
                    upon Isaac, who cleverly manipulated the witch trial.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Childhood</h3>
                <p>
                    Hector had a difficult childhood. He was born as the son of an alchemist. At an early age, he found
                    that animals gravitated toward him, both animals of the day and animals of the night. Other children
                    and adults thought that this was unnatural and did not accept him. This caused his mother grief and
                    she exclaimed to him that she wished he was never born. The only things his father was interested in
                    was wealth, honor, control, and protection by those in power and barely noticed that Hector existed.
                    <br><br>
                    One day, the animals that had witnessed the cruelty of his fellow humans and decided to help him
                    "escape" his predicament. They caused the church to catch on fire and perhaps cost the lives of his
                    family and neighbors. They told him that he was free now and should be happy that they got what they
                    deserved. They told him to go to the one place in the world where he would be allowed to live and
                    led him to Dracula's Castle.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h3>At Dracula's Castle</h3>
                <p>
                    Hector entered into the care of Dracula's Castle two years after another aspiring Devil Forgemaster
                    had entered there, Isaac. There he was recognized as perhaps the most promising human resident
                    there. Hector believed that power was what mattered in the world and that it did not matter if the
                    power was "evil", for power was truly neither evil nor good. He mastered the arts of devil alchemy
                    that enabled him to create living creatures using base materials.
                    <br><br>
                    Isaac respected him but became jealous of his position of Dracula's favorite.Hector and Isaac's
                    power grew and they soon became
                    Dracula's generals and were considered equals to Death himself. Dracula sent them to ravage the
                    countryside and turned his domain of Wallachia, which he had once protected, into a wasteland for
                    betraying him. Hector did not wish to use his power to do this and did not want to kill humans even
                    though they had never loved him because he himself was one. He obeyed his master though for many
                    months. He pleaded his lord to not make him kill them anymore, but his concerns were brushed aside.

            <div class="appearance">
                <h2>Trivia</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Hector shares some common traits with Alucard: Both of them can have familiars fighting alongside
                    them,
                    skills with multiple weapons and magic, and the attitude of defection from Dracula's grasp.
                    Hector's name is most famously known for being that of one noble but unfortunate Trojan general,
                    whom
                    Achilles dispatched. The name itself is Greek in origin and means "holding fast" - appropriate for
                    the
                    steadfast forgemaster. It is Hector's strength, will and perseverance that saved him from becoming
                    Dracula's next host.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    His blue eyes, like Isaac's red hair, are a trait associated with vampirism in Balkan mythology and
                    in
                    folklore from some parts of Greece. These stories held that a blue-eyed person would become a
                    vampire
                    after death, or that they were already vampiric in nature. It is speculated that Hector and Isaac
                    are no
                    longer mortal men - although Dracula considers them still to be human, and thus lesser.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It's worth pointing out the contrast between Isaac and Hector physical appearance; their dressing
                    style
                    is very different, as is the color of their hair. Isaac's fiery red hair may be taken as a symbol of
                    hatred and anger, while Hector's white hair may be thought of as a symbol of purity, wisdom and
                    nobility. In short, Hector is the opposite of everything Isaac has become.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>Fightes</h2>
                <br>

                <h3>Battle-Type</h3>
                <p>
                    The second Innocent Devil is summoned in the Baljhet Mountains. As the name suggests, Battle Devils
                    are
                    pure killing machines, with great melee abilities, created to attack enemies and protect Hector.
                    They
                    can open metal doors that bar Hector's passage (for example, the one blocking the Mortvia Aqueduct
                    in
                    the mountains). Hector can perform Chain Attacks with them. They are one of three types also seen
                    used
                    by Isaac, who uses an Iytei and a Rasetz.
                </p>

                <h3>Bird-Type</h3>
                <p>
                    The third Innocent Devil is summoned in the Mortvia Aqueduct. Bird Devils are good in air battle and
                    can
                    help Hector for jumping over large holes that cannot ordinarily be passed by lifting Hector and
                    flying
                    for a short amount of time, the ability of which can be upgraded to access the Tower of Evermore.
                    They
                    can juggle light enemies, allowing Hector to air combo easily. This is one of three types also seen
                    used
                    by Isaac, who uses a Crimson.
                </p>

                <h3>Mage-Type</h3>
                <p>
                    The fourth Innocent Devil is summoned in Cordova Town. Mage Devils are physically weak, being not
                    very
                    good at fighting enemies physically, but can cast powerful spells which inflict heavy area damage.
                    They
                    can also help Hector by using a "stop time" spell, which, for a limited time, freezes time for
                    everything but Hector and bosses, who can immediately break the spell.
