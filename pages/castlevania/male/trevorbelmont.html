                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    Trevor C. Belmont (known in Japan as Ralph C. Belmondo (ラルフ・Ｃ・ベルモンド Rarufu Shī Berumondo?)) is a
                    member of the ancestral Belmont Clan of vampire hunters who lived during the 15th century. He was
                    introduced in the Castlevania series as the main protagonist of the 1989-90 game, Castlevania III:
                    Dracula's Curse; reprising this role in the Pachislot Akumajō Dracula subseries. Because he and his
                    relatives were feared by the people for their supernatural powers, the Belmont Clan lived outside of
                    society.Trevor is renowned for being the first man who defeated Count Dracula.
                    <br><br>
                    Trevor has also made many appearances in other installments of the series, as well as other related
                    productions, often appearing as a supporting character, or as an alternate version of himself in a
                    different continuity, or simply making a cameo. He plays a supportive narrative role in Castlevania:
                    Curse of Darkness and its visual novel adaptation, and even has his own mode in the former, where he
                    becomes a playable character with his own adventure and unique moveset.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>
                    Trevor's personality has been further explored in Curse of Darkness and the Pachislot series. Here,
                    Trevor is a proud warrior confident of his abilities but solemn and cautious. He is a bit of a
                    hot-head and straight forward, and perhaps slightly rude to intimidate his adversaries; however, he
                    remains a man of justice fighting for good; he helps Hector after testing him and noticing his good
                    intentions, and lets him to defeat Isaac and end the Curse of Dracula.
                    <br><br>
                    Trevor was redesigned by Takeshi Obata for Castlevania Judgment, where he sports short, spiky hair
                    and a leather attire with many belts covering his scars from his battle with Dracula. He also covers
                    his eye –which seems not yet to be healed– with a patch. This is a reference to his scarred eye in
                    Curse of Darkness, fully recovered after some years. He behaves as a proud member of the Belmont
                    Clan, a veteran honorable hero, confident and energetic, similar to Simon, but more mature. He came
                    to accept and trust his superhuman powers that made him a feared person, a reference to the prologue
                    of Dracula's Curse, and is well aware of his deeds, that made him a legend for future generations.

            <div class="appearance">
                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>
                    Trevor first debuted in Dracula's Curse for the Nintendo Entertainment System, where he was designed
                    by T. Fujimoto and I. Urata. In his debut appearance, Trevor's design shares many similarities with
                    Simon Belmont. He is equipped with a breastplate, leather (or fur) lower garments, boots and two
                    shoulder plates. He has long, brown hair.
                    <br><br>
                    Trevor's design from the American and European covers closely matches his appearance from the
                    Japanese instruction booklet. Trevor is depicted with the same outfit in the Japanese manual, but
                    his hair is brown instead of blond and he doesn't wear a cape.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h2>Trivia</h2>
                <p>

                    In Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, he is mentioned several times in the story. The first being
                    during the introductory text, as Alucard is mentioned to have teamed up with him. Later, when Maria
                    asks Alucard if she knew of Richter Belmont, Alucard mentions the Belmont Family name and the sprite
                    shows a thought bubble of Trevor's sprite from Dracula's Curse, the warrior he tagged along with in
                    1476. And finally, when Richter learns the name of the dhampir that just fought him, he recalls the
                    history of how his ancestor with the help of Alucard vanished Dracula 300 years prior (although this
                    is only on the original PlayStation release).
                    <br>
                    In addition, zombies that take the shape of Trevor, Grant Danasty and Sypha Belnades, can be fought
                    as optional bosses (these would reappear in Portrait of Ruin, also as optional bosses).
                    In the Castlevania: The Belmont Legacy graphic novel, a painting that references Trevor's appearance
                    on the American box cover appears in the Belmont mausoleum.
                    <br><br>
                    In Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin, Trevor's image appears alongside his fellow Belmonts (Leon, Simon,
                    Juste and Richter) when the Greatest Five Dual Crush is cast. He will randomly appear in either his
                    32-bit sprite of his fake zombie appearance from Symphony of the Night (now colored brown instead of
                    his original olive color) or in his original sprite from Dracula's Curse.
                    <br>
                    In the artbook The Art of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, his concept art for this alternate universe
                    looks exactly the same than Trevor's design in Castlevania: Curse of Darkness. This is a reference
                    and basis for his new appearance, which was used by the art team that worked on the Lords of Shadow
                    games.
