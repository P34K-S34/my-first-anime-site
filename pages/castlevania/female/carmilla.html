                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Carmilla was a former general of Dracula's army. She was the last vampire general to arrive at
                    Dracula's Castle, although this being due to having had her own hidden agenda. It was soon
                    revealed that she was not pleased with Dracula's plans of mankind's extinction, mainly because
                    this would leave the entire vampire population without a stable sustenance of blood.
                    <br><br>
                    She was turned into a vampire centuries ago by an unknown Vampire Lord, whom she later killed,
                    claiming that he was "old and cruel" to those around him.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Carmilla</b> is portrayed as a femme fatale, both seductive and manipulative. She is also selfish and
                    will do anything to accomplish her goals. She proved very politically skilled as she was able to
                    twist the affairs of Dracula's council on itself to even questioning him while maintaining the
                    appearance that she was loyal. While cunning and cautious, Carmilla tends to be arrogant and
                    overconfident. Despite Dracula's great personal power and his army of demons, she believed she could
                    overthrow him by simply killing his vampire generals and attacking him directly. Given the extent of
                    Dracula's power revealed later on in his confrontation with Sypha, Trevor, and Alucard, this was
                    highly unlikely to succeed.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Carmilla</b> is both persistent and opportunistic, and even
                    though her attempted usurpation against Dracula failed and most of her forces were destroyed, she
                    did not admit defeat, only viewing it as a setback. With Dracula dead at the hands of Alucard,
                    Trevor Belmont, and Sypha Belnades, Carmilla aimed to fill the power vacuum in the wake of Dracula's
                    death and that of his council, even taking a former General in Dracula's army as her personal pet
                    and slave.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Carmilla</b> possesses a twisted and dark sense of humor with a penchant for violence, as is custom in
                    Vampire culture. This is revealed when she confesses to Godbrand that she killed the vampire that
                    turned her. According to Carmilla, after her old master went mad, he became 'old and cruel'. She
                    then later went on to capture and enslave Hector, her 'pet', taking delight in beating and verbally
                    berating the Forgemaster, and sadistically enjoying dominating him because he was a stupid man
                    child.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Carmilla</b> is a natural leader, charismatic and visionary. She is acknowledged as first among the four
                    queens of Styria because she sees a future for the kingdom and provides purpose. The execution of
                    her vision falls to her sisters or those she manipulates. She rarely engages in any dirty work
                    herself. Being more into scheming, conniving, and underhanded tactics than leading from the front.
                    Carmilla has a pathological need to control and dominate her environment. She justifies her
                    leadership by likening everyone else as "children, animals, and dying old men" unworthy of agency.
                    <br><br>
                    In contrast to Carmilla's other arrogant traits, she appears to be wary of the Belmont Family, as
                    she loudly apprised the other vampire generals that the Belmonts hunted vampires like them for many
                    centuries and even just one remaining Belmont would be a problem. Carmilla's concern was correct, as
                    Trevor soundly butchered vampire soldiers from her army, as well as the vampire generals, and helped
                    Alucard and Sypha slay Dracula himself. Carmilla's fear of the Belmonts contrasts with Dracula's
                    initial mocking indifference to Trevor.

            <div class="appearance">
                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>Carmilla bears the appearance of an elegant and majestic pale woman with crimson red lips, icy
                    blue eyes, and long straight white hair. Although her face is mostly round, she has a
                    notoriously pointy chin, which could likely be a reference to her mask initially seen in
                    Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. She is also seen wearing a black and crimson red ombre dress,
                    sporting golden shoulder plates and matching heels. While in Styria, Carmilla always dons
                    several long, elegant blood-red dresses with golden accessories and heels. Her nightgown had an
                    open cleavage with a single button below the chest and golden, rounded shoulder pads.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>
                <p>

                <h3>Immortality</h3>

                <p>As a vampire, Carmilla is immortal and cannot die of old age, keeping her youthful and
                supple body despite having lived for hundreds of years.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Superhuman strength</h3>

                <p>Carmilla possesses far more strength than normal humans and other vampires. In
                fact, she kicked Godbrand with enough speed and force to knock him down a staircase and then pin him
                to ground with her foot. She was capable of carrying Hector and beating him to a pulp with barely
                making any effort. Carmilla further showed her terrifying strength when she flipped a long table
                across a room with one hand, ripped a night creature's head with a flick and easily dismembered
                dozens of night creatures with her curved blade, even hewing their weapons. Carmilla was also
                capable of kicking back some of the mightiest night creatures, such as Abel, several meters and to
                cause a wave of blood to sweep Isaac's creatures away.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Superhuman speed</h3>

                <p>Carmilla can move at extraordinary speed in short bursts, not unlike Alucard,
                leaving red flashes of her movement that are hard to read with the human eye. This speed is so high
                that it is nearly indistinguishable from teleportation, and at its peak, it sparks electric flashes
                around her frame. Carmilla can use this ability to instantly move through an enemy while slicing
                them to shreds. Isaac, a highly lethal combatant in his own right, was unable to react to Carmilla's
                movements under his own reflexes, needing to rely on his night creatures to absorb her blows.
                Superhuman agility and endurance: Carmilla possesses great agility, capable of jumping dozens of
                meters and performing incredible and nimble acrobatics, even while wearing heels. She also possesses
                great endurance, resisting the onslaught of night creatures, killing dozens of them until the floor
                was flooded with blood before she started tiring. Even when she faced Isaac, she could still move at
                blinding speed and resist several grievous injuries while fighting.
                </p>
                <br>
                
                <h3>Swordsmanship</h3>

                <p>Carmilla was shown to be a truly terrifying creature that possess great skill with
                her curved blade, similar to a shashka. In her final moments, the Queen of Styria cut through
                unending hoards of Isaac's night creature forces, covering the entire room floor in blood. This not
                only proved her incredible fighting prowess and savage nature, but also a resilient stamina.
