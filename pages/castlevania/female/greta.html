                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Greta is a character in the Castlevania animated series. She is the head woman of Danesti village and
                    defends it against night creatures.
                    <br><br>
                    Greta's family arrived in the area that would become Danesti generations before her, escaping from
                    the Romans according to her knowledge. They came to that area back when it was "just a wide spot in
                    the road" and settled it, along with others who would travel from scattered locations seeking a
                    community to call their own. She became the head woman of the town in her time, acting as its leader
                    and commander.
                    <br><br>
                    When Alucard arrived, Greta made a point of making it clear she wasn't going to let him
                    half-heartedly aid her people, as they were her responsibility and her calling on him fell to her if
                    it went badly. When he affirmed that he was sincere in his offer of aid, Greta decided that Danesti
                    was no longer defensible, and the decision was made to relocate the villagers to Dracula's Castle,
                    which would offer more protection. Along the way, Greta made mention of her ability to sense magic
                    in people and its affiliation as a result of living remotely and closer to nature, and used the
                    opportunity to voice her distrust of Saint Germain, who'd taken up refuge in Danesti recently and
                    traveled with the group. She also made evident her ability to fight, taking out night creatures
                    single-handedly.
                    <br><br>
                    Upon arriving at the castle, Greta took to setting up the rest of the villagers. As a settlement was
                    constructed, Greta started going through the castle's pantries, looking for ways to stretch the
                    foodstuffs the villagers brought further, and talked to Alucard about the castle's defense, coming
                    that she hoped the castle doors would keep people away. By nightfall, however, the grounds around
                    the castle were invaded by the vampire Dragan and his armies, following the instructions of Saint
                    Germain in the hope of performing Dracula's resurrection. Greta mounted as much of a defense as
                    possible, which could help to fight the night army, but was forced indoors by the onslaught.
                    Eventually, however, Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades were teleported to the castle to aid Alucard,
                    and the three pushed back against the monsters while Greta helped defend her people.

                <br>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>
                    Greta is a leader, whether it be naturally or through necessity of running such a remote village as
                    Danesti. As the head woman of the community, she has the responsibility of keeping everyone safe and
                    provided for; thus, she is a strong-willed and straightforward woman who emphasizes the priorities
                    of the villagers over everything else. She doesn't hold back on her observations and opinions, such
                    as her blunt breakdown of her views pertaining to both Alucard's arrival at Danesti and her
                    suspiciousness of Saint Germain.

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>
                    – Greta: I'm not interested in magic tricks and one fight. These people are under my care. Will you
                    stay and defend them for as long as it takes?<br>
                    – Alucard: I <said class="br"></said>
                    – Greta: I need you to understand. I don't know you. You've been 20-odd miles away for months. You
                    creep around the forest. You've got bodies on stakes outside your weird castle. You're obviously
                    half-vampire and you stink of wine, and you appear to me to be at least half-crazy. But you were the
                    only possible advantage I could think of. I don't need to be impressed by low-key swagger. I need
                    you to commit to saving these people. Because my life isn't worth living I can't save theirs. <br>
                    – Alucard: All done?<br>
                    – Greta: Did it work? <br>
                    – Alucard: Yes. <br>
                    – Greta: Then I'm all done. Thank you. <br>
                    - ("You Must Sacrifice") <br>
                    "Look at them die! I know you're all tired and scared, but they're just bloody animals! Kill the
                    bastards!" ("Back in the World") <br>
                    "My family came here from generations ago. They escaped from the Romans, so the story goes... My
                    family's here. We've been in Danesti since it was just a wide spot in the road. People from all over
                    wash up here and stay. We don't trace back to anywhere." ("Back in the World") <br>
                    "I had a boyfriend and a girlfriend at the same time once, but they never tried to kill me.
                    Actually, no. I tell a lie. His wife went for me with a pitchfork." ("Back in the World") <br>
                </p>

                <br>





                <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>
                <p>

                <h3>Combat knowledge</h3>

                <p>
                    Greta has some skill in fighting, including armed combat with a sword and hammer. She
                    wields both weapons in unison and has been able to take down several night creatures single-handedly.
                    Even Alucard was surprised by his good fighting style.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Magic perception</h3>

                <p> Due to Danesti's isolation in the wilderness and proximity to the "spirits of storm
                    and stream", Greta is used to being around natural magic and can sense it when in range of someone who
                    has magical ability. She was able to sense both Alucard and Saint Germain's magical affinity and assign
                    specific smells to what a person's magic is aligned with, such as when she told Alucard his magic
                    smelled "sweet like spices", indicating that his magic was used for good, while describing Saint
                    Germain's as smelling like "manure", indicating that his magic was dark.
