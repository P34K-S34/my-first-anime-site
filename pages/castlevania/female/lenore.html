                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    While growing up as a human, she was a child of war. At the age of 5, she had already seen enough
                    war and her life didn't get better after that. It was also implied that she was a noblewoman of high
                    status, as she stated "I grew up in a castle like this" to Hector when referring to the castle of
                    Styria. Her parents were murdered when "English soldiers climbed up the toilet chutes with knives in
                    their teeth".
                    <br><br>
                    As a vampire, Lenore eventually rose to become one of the top members of the Council of Sisters,
                    residing in Carmilla's castle in Styria. She was described as being the group's diplomat and used
                    her persuasion and seduction skills to obtain what she needed. As a diplomat, she was in charge of
                    making peace with neighboring countries.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>
                    Lenore is the diplomat of the group and is good at getting others to trust her. While she appears to
                    be kind and honest, she is as shrewd and calculating as her sisters... perhaps even more so. As
                    such, she is not above using underhanded tactics to get results, such as manipulation and
                    gaslighting, which is exemplified when she seduces Hector before making him her slave. She does stay
                    somewhat true to her word, though, as she doesn't return Hector to his cell, but allows him to live
                    in the castle with her and her sisters, although he is still condemned to a life of servitude.
                    <br><br>
                    Lenore is shown to take her job as the Styria Council's diplomat very seriously, as seen during her
                    first interactions with Hector, where she made it viciously clear that she wasn't weak and to never
                    assume that she was an easy target to either manipulate or underestimate due to her innocent
                    appearance, demanding respect as an equal from her prisoner.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to her duty as a diplomat, Lenore has shown herself to be incredibly tactful, pragmatic, and
                    patient when negotiating with others, as seen during her negotiations with Hector, were she made
                    sure to be both precise and patient during the course of her visits to carefully dissect his
                    mentality and glean the proper method to manipulate him into doing what she wanted, while ensuring
                    at the same time that he remained oblivious to her subtle manipulation and analysis of him.
                    <br><br>
                    Lenore also possesses the strong personal belief and value in the practice of commerce, having the
                    firm belief that everyone has to have some sort of desire for whatever action they do, and believes
                    that everyone deserves a proper reward for their services given, as stated by her during her talks
                    with Hector, where she also reveals that she believes this method is the best tool to be used during
                    negotiations, which ensures that everyone involved in the proceedings is content; and believing that
                    other motivational tools, such as faith, are weak tools during negotiations.
                    <br><br>
                    One such example is portrayed in "The Reparation of My Heart", where Carmilla presented her plan for
                    turning humans into endless supply of blood. To Carmilla's remark about humans being
                    "self-replicating food", Lenore appeared rather upset - she clearly didn't feel good about such
                    maniacal attitude, but when grinning, Morana noticed her expression, Lenore tried to hide her
                    feelings. Also, Lenore's reaction to the story of the spider was exaggeratedly dismissive since she
                    likely didn't want to admit her compassionate nature to her sisters, who were picking on her for it.

            <div class="appearance">
                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>
                    Lenore's appearance is that of a slender beautiful young woman of shorter stature, with pale skin,
                    ginger red hair and red eyes. Like all vampires, she has pointed ears and sharp fangs. The sides of
                    her hair are gathered into a small long braid on her back, with a silver hair ornament and a
                    translucent veil attached, covering part of the hair. The rest of the hair is wavy and worn loose.
                    She wears a dark navy blue dress with teal embellishments and trimmings and partially covered at the
                    shoulders by a fluffy white coat. She has a belt with a bat-like symbol on the buckle, and she also
                    wears a silver necklace and studs.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>
                <p>

                <h3>Diplomacy and manipulation</h3>

                <p>
                    Lenore is a very skilled diplomat, capable of setting the premises for fruitful negotiation. She is,
                    however, very good at understanding her interlocutors and building a seemingly even relationship to
                    gain their trust and manipulate them. As Carmilla noted, Lenore has a "sweet little girl act" that
                    has served her well despite her actually kinder nature.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Administrative skills</h3>

                <p>
                    After Morana had left with Striga to survey the lands they planned to annex, Lenore was stated to
                    have taken over some of her duties in running Styria's government, hinting that she also possesses
                    the necessary skills to run their kingdom's administration and handle its economy.
                    Vampire physiology: Being a vampire, Lenore has several supernatural abilities.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Immortality</h3>

                <p>
                    Like other vampires, Lenore doesn't age.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Skilled combatant</h3>

                <p>
                    Lenore is knowledgeable of very advanced hand-to-hand combat techniques (namely, Martial Arts),
                    which she employs during encounters in conjunction with her other abilities.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Bat swarming</h3>

                <p>
                    Lenore has the ability to transform her body into a swarm of bats, which, besides providing a rapid
                    mean of displacement and the ability to quickly gain a vantage point, also allows her to
                    effortlessly escape an adversary's grasp. Lenore has also shown to primarily use this ability as a
                    fast mode of travel around the castle of Styria.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Air mimicry</h3>

                <p>
                    Similarly to Chō, Lenore can transform her body into mist, allowing her to phase through certain
                    obstacles (such as prison bars).
                </p>
